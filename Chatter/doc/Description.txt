Free for a limited time. Get it now! Based on feedback from early users, I intend to incorporate the
features that are most sought after, and eventually start charging for Chatter.

Chatter will import and index all of your chat logs (handling hundreds of thousands with easy), 
making them accessible and searchable to you. The intuitive interface lets you find the information 
you're looking for quickly and easily.

The first step is to import your existing iChat, Adium or Trillian chat logs, which is as easy as 
selecting a directory. Moments later, you can filter the displayed data set by selecting names from 
the buddy list or search for messages containing any set of words.

Updating is as easy as the original import, and you don't have to worry about duplicate messages
because Chatter will only import each message once.
